# SlimeTECH
*Looking for the download link? [**Click here**](Placeholder)*

SlimeTECH is a plugin which aims to turn your Bukkit Server into a modpack without ever installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks! SlimeTECH lets every player decide on their own how much they want to dive into Magic or Technology.<br>
We got everything from magical wands to nuclear reactors and more.<br>
We feature a magical altar, an electric power grid with Electricity Meters and even item transport systems.

This project is based on Slimefun, and is currently being managed and worked on by 3 people to update and bring this plugin to a newer and higher glory.<br>
We would love to continue working on this plugin and expand the community, having official and unofficial addons alike, we wish to update the plugin to 1.21.11 bring new functionality and updated items.<br>
It currently adds over **500 new items and recipes** to Minecraft, in which we aim to at least double. ([Read more about the history of Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Slimefun-in-a-nutshell)).

SlimeTECH won't be compatible with any current Slimefun Addons but we are willing to work with anyone who would like to bring their addon over and update it.

## :floppy_disk: Download SlimeTECH 1
SlimeTECH requires your Minecraft Server to be running on [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/), [Paper](https://papermc.io/) or on any fork of these.<br>
(See also: [How to install SlimeTECH](https://github.com/SlimeTECH/SlimeTECH1/wiki/Installing-SlimeTECH))

SlimeTECH 1 can be downloaded **for free** on our builds page.<br>
We currently provide two distinct versions of SlimeTECH, development builds and "stable" builds.<br>
Here is a full summary of the differences between the two different versions of SlimeTECH.

| **Download links** | :floppy_disk: **[download latest](https://blob.build/project/SlimeTECH1/Dev)** | :floppy_disk: **[download "stable"](https://blob.build/project/SlimeTECH/RC)** |

**:exclamation: We recommend you use stable versions as those will be the least buggy forms of our plugin, however we will update Development Builds more often.**
<details>
  <summary>Here's why...</summary>
  
Stable builds do not receive frequent updates as we take time in ensuring that the stable versions are the least buggy they can be before release. As time goes on, bugs are fixed but it will take some time until these fixes make it into a stable build. We will also not accept or review any bug reports from stable builds.

**:question: Why use a stable build then?**<br>
While stable builds most definitely have less bugs than development builds due to the time we spend ensuring they are not buggy. you can be sure that they will not include __game-breaking__ issues, but rest assured that we will try to ensure development builds almost never contain such issues either.

**:question: What exactly are these stable builds?**<br>
Stable builds are literally just the least buggy development builds that seemed to run fine without any __major__ issues. Stable builds will be the final download of an update, development build will be the "Snapshot" updates. Otherwise potential issues may go unnoticed and slip into a "stable" build.

## :framed_picture: Screenshots
So what does SlimeTECH look like?<br>
Well, we haven't been around long enough for screenshots from users to actually come in, so it may be a while:

## :exclamation: Disclaimers
SlimeTECH 1 uses various systems that collect usage information or download automatic updates as well as the latest information about the project.
We do not collect any personal information from you but there are some services that may gather or download some form of data.

You can opt-out of the Auto-Updater and stats collection at any time!

<details>
  <summary>Automatic updates</summary>
  
SlimeTECH 1 uses an Auto-Updater which connects to (Not here yet) to check for and download updates.<br>
This behaviour is enabled by default but can be turned off under `/plugins/SlimeTECH/config.yml`.<br>
We highly recommend you to keep this on at any time though, as you could be missing out on important patches.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Metrics and Statistics</summary>
  
SlimeTECH 1 uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574) to collect anonymous information about the usage of this plugin.<br>
This is solely for statistical purposes, as we are interested in how Servers/Players use this plugin.<br>
All available data is anonymous and aggregated, at no point can we see individual server or player information.<br>
All of the collected data is publicly accessible: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574

You can also disable this behaviour under `/plugins/bStats/config.yml`.<br>
For more info see [bStats' Privacy Policy](https://bstats.org/privacy-policy)

Our [bStats Module](https://github.com/SlimeTECH/MetricsModule) is downloaded automatically when installing this Plugin, this module will automatically update on server starts independently from the main plugin. This way we can automatically roll out updates to the bStats module, in cases of severe performance issues for example where live data and insight into what is impacting performance can be crucial.
These updates can of course be disabled under `/plugins/SlimeTECH/config.yml`. To disable metrics collection as a whole, see the paragraph above.
